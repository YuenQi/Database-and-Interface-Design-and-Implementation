First, you need to create a database using phpMyAdmin by giving it a name "entertainment".
Then, import the entertainment.sql (in the Dump database folder) to the database.
After that, just start the Xampp web server and execute index.php file in the browser in locahost.
You can perform create, read, update and delete actions to the database.
